The objective of our web application is to display the habit of the student on basis of the weekday. Once the user hits on the habit, it shows some images, descriptions in the text, the user will get to see whether the habit is done today or not. If the user completes the habit for the day then we can add some points or credits to their account.

## External Requirements
• To execute my project on your laptop, first install **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)**. </br>
• You need to have an account on the **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** for the database. </br>
• The workload **ASP.NET and web development** must be installed using the **Visual Studio installer**. </br>
• In the visual studio installer, you must install **.NET 5.0** from **individual components** </br>

## Setup
#### Following are the requirements to set up the virtual studio after cloning the my repository.

• In Visual Studio, open the HabitApp.sln file.</br>
• Click on Tools > Options > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Package for solution. </br>
• look for **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http** and **MongoDB.Driver** install in solution's driver.</br>
> - **If you're having trouble installing, go to the gear icon > Select the ➕ symbol.** </br>
> - **nuget.org is the name** </br>
> - **https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json is the source.** </br>
> - **After that, click Update and then Ok. </br>**

## Deployment

• We made it easier for the application to be **deployed** automatically When you make any **changes** to the repository, the **build** will start **deploying** to Heroku **automatically**. </br>
• If you make any changes to a repo and they **aren't** automatically deployed, try **manually** deploying them to see if they show up in the app.

## Test
• In Visual Studio, I added the necessary **[tools](https://github.com/RohitChandupatla/proposal-notify-myhabit/blob/main/studiotools.md)** for unit testing our code.</br>
• After you've installed all of the tools, you'll notice a unit test section option in your right-click menu.</br>
• To get code coverage, follow this process.</br>
  
  1. Unit test debugging </br>
  2. Covering the unit test</br>
  3. Run a unit test</br>
 
 
• For unit testing, we **utilized Xunit** </br>
• The Coverage Report was generated with the help of **dotCover**. </br>
