# Notify-MyHabit

The objective of our web application is to display the habit of the student on basis of the weekday. Once the user hits on the habit, it shows some images, descriptions in the text, the user will get to see whether the habit is done today or not. If the user completes the habit for the day then we can add some points or credits to the account.

## External Requirements
To **execute** my project first you need to install [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and then you need to install [**C#**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) and [**MongoDB**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mongodb.mongodb-vscode) extensions in order to get my app to run in your laptop. </br>

## App is still in under development
We have only recently started our project, therefore we will need some time to update how we can **set up, deploy, and test** our project.
